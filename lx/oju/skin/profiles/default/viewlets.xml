    <!-- The definition of a viewlet accepts these parameters:
         - name: quite self explanatory, the name of the viewlet.
         - insert-before: name of the viewlet before which it must be added or
           moved.
         - insert-after: name of the viewlet after which it must be added
           or moved.
         - remove: supported but rarely needed, removes the viewlet from the
           ordering list (doesn't mean that it hides the viewlet).
         Note: insert-before and -after accept the value "*" which means
         "all".
